# TextSortingInFile

Program actions:<br>
* opens the .txt file;
* reads the file into the string;
* clothes the file;
* deletes all the symbols from the string which words can't contain;
* splits the string by the whitespaces and writes result into array;
* checks the spelling of each word in array with the dictionary;
* writes result into the HashMap<String,Integer>, where value of String - words, value of Integer - how many times the word was used in text;
* sorts HashMap (two ways of sorting - by the alphabet and by the words occurance);
* writes result into the file Output.txt
